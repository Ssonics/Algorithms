Algorithms
==========

These are Groovy implementations of various algorithms from [Introduction to Algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein (CLRS).

They're much like the pseudocode declarations you see in the book, except they're runnable, debugabble, and more readable.
